## Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up and running the server for this project.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, you need to install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to run JavaScript code on your computer, and npm is a tool that comes with Node.js and allows you to install JavaScript packages.

1. Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/). This will also install npm.

### Installing Dependencies

Once you have Node.js and npm installed, you can install the dependencies for this project. Dependencies are additional packages of code that this project relies on.

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where you have this project.
3. Once you're in the project directory, type `npm install` and press Enter. This will install the dependencies.

### Running the Server

After the dependencies are installed, you can run the server.

1. In the terminal, make sure you're still in the project directory.
2. Type 'npm run dev' and press Enter. This will start the server.
3. You should see a message saying "Server is running on port 3000". This means the server is running and you can access it by going to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

If you have any issues, please refer to the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) or seek help online.
